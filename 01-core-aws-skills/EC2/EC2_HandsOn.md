# EC2 Hands-On Practice – 20 Oct 2025

### Steps I Did
1. Logged into AWS Console.
2. Launched EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2).
3. Configured key pair and security group (port 22 open for SSH).
4. Connected via terminal using SSH.
5. Stopped & terminated instance after testing.

### Learnings
- Key pair (.pem) is used for authentication.
- Security groups control inbound & outbound traffic.
- Stopping vs Terminating: Stopped → can restart; Terminated → deleted.

### Next Step
→ Create S3 bucket and host static website.
