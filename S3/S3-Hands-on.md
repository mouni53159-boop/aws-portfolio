# S3 Hands-On Practice – 21 Oct 2025

### Steps I Did
1. Created S3 bucket: `mouni-aws-portfolio-bucket` in ap-south-1.
2. Uploaded sample text & image files.
3. Enabled static website hosting with index.html.
4. Checked public access settings & bucket policy.
5. Opened S3 website endpoint in browser.

### Learnings
- S3 is object-based storage, not block-based.
- Buckets are globally unique.
- Public access can be controlled at bucket or object level.
- Static website hosting = easy way to host simple sites.
- Versioning helps recover overwritten files.

### Next Step
→ IAM (Identity & Access Management): create users, roles, and policies.
